My doctor told me that this medication was non-addictive. Even when I described the physical and mental effects I was experiencing from withdrawl, she insisted that this was due only to the bodies struggle to rid itself of a chemical. If this is not addiction then what is? It soon became obvious to me that, after taking the pills for a month, the patient knows far more about them that the doctor and they are, in effect, on their own.

Two weeks ago I took my last half-tablet after gradually reducing the amount I was taking. The side-effects I have experienced are as follows:
/n
/n
1. Panic attacks far worse than I experienced before going onto the drug.
/n
2. disorientation and trouble keeping my balance.
/n
3. Involuntary crying and the feeling that I cannot cope with the slightest problem.
/n
4. Depression and sleeplessness.
/n
5. Stomach cramps and sickness.
/n
6. Dizziness when standing up.
/n
7. Tiredness and mood swings.

I am posting this message because the withdrawl of this so-called non-addictive drug makes you feel as though this is the 'normal' state the patient is returning to. As though this disorientation, that makes you feel 'crazy' and out-of-touch with the world is how you are going to feel forever. But this is not the case as i am realising as the time since taking my last tablet increases. My father took Vallium in the sixties and was told at the time it was a non-addictive drug. This is now obviously not the case and I wonder if, in time, the same might be true of paroxetine. The withdrawl effects are severe enough to warrant further tests I'm sure.</bodytext></report>
