In my town everybody did X. It was just the thing to do. I had never done it i was always to scared. then one day my friend was like 'ill give it to you and if you like it come back to me.'  So i thought what tha hell it was only once. So i got 2 of them one for me and one for my boyfriend.

I took it and i didnt feel anything at all for like an hour and i was like this is stupid. So i was watching tv and it just hit me... really hard! i had never felt anything like that before so i didnt know how to act. i saw devils on the walls and it looked like snakes were slithering under the carpet. i freaked out. my boyfriend was wiggin out of his mind and at the same time trying to calm me down. so i sat on the couch and i was like blacking out and then coming back kinda like my eyes were blinking really really slow but i wasnt blinking. and then all of a sudden my stomach started cramping up really bad and i just started throwing up everywhere!

And we thought that maybe since i threw up it would wear off or something. i just got worse i started crying and telling my boyfriend that when i died i was going to miss him and all kinds of crazy stuff like that. cause i had it in my mind that it was going to kill me. i was trying to call my mom and tell her bye and thats when he took me to the ER. I dont remember much after that.. but they told me that if i hadnt gone in i would have died. Thats why i dont touch the stuff no more.... all my friends do and im always there to take care of them.</bodytext></report>
