At 10:45PM, I put about 30mg of DPT HCl into my usual improvised free-base pipe, and vaporize it. The chamber of the pipe fills with thick white smoke. I inhale... it tastes similar to 5-MeO-DMT, but more acrid. It also leaves a strange burning sensation on my lips which lingers for the duration of the experience. Immediately, I feel my chest tighten up, and my heart start to beat fast. This feels alot like 5-MeO-DMT, but milder... it is as if the DPT mental effects are absent, leaving only the physical effects... but even those are altered somehow, shifted more towards the 5-MeO-DMT end of the tryptamine spectrum. I'm amazed that the route of ingestion makes this much difference!

By a cosmic act of synchronicity, the moment I put down the pipe, the wind outside whips up to fierce intensity - March coming in like a lion, I guess. I hear windchimes. I feel none of the usual mental flow insufflated DPT facilitates. I may as well have done a low dose of MeO. By 11:10PM, the effects have declined dramatically, leaving just an afterglow. I wonder if smoking free-base DPT is also this MeO-like, or if that's just some strange result of smoking the HCl salt... either way, I don't intend to try smoking the HCl again.</bodytext></report>
