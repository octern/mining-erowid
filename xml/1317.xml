The first time I tried DXM, I was at work. I had been partying all night, and I needed something to pick me up, and caffeine wasn't doing the trick. I had heard through friends that Robitussin could make you trip, and I was really curious. So during my break I grabbed a bottle of Robitussin DM Max Strength.

Following the initial experience, I wasn't too impressed. I hadn't taken more than half, and the taste was quite nauseating. But for some reason I was on the quest to do more. I began taking it on weekends, when there was nothing to do, and on days I had off, for fun. I grew to like the Robo Trip. Until my friends found out.

I was under constant scrutiny, because they were sure I was reaching addiction. For a period of 3 months, DXM was all I did, despite what anyone said. But I had an awful experience that prompted me to stop, cold turkey.

I was at a friends house one night, and we were lounging around, the guy I have liked forever was there, and we got on the subject of the Robo Trip. It got me thinking about the bottle that was in my purse, and I excused myself, went to the bathroom and drank the whole bottle. When I returned, T asked me what I did. My best friend looked at me, and said 'she just drank a bottle'. T was amazed that I carried it around with me, so he went to the bathroom, and grabbed another bottle, and coaxed me to drink it.

In an hour, he decided to take us out, and I was tripping pretty hard. His car was stuck in snow, and I had to help push it out. I started to go catatonic. They were so worried about me, and I desperately wished to tell them I was okay, I had auditory hallucinations as well as visual, swirling in my head, and I wasn't really in a talking mood.

I came to realize so many things that night, I cried myself to sleep. The worst thing of all was the depression seeping in, uninvited. I was upset for days afterwards.

T convinced me not to do it anymore, because he did not like the person I had become because of it, and truthfully, neither did I.

So kids, if you're looking for a way to get your kicks, stay with the tried and true standard--Marijuana.</bodytext></report>
