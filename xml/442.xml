With much mental preparation, my coleagues and I had a small test line of the ketamine that we had taken from a liquid to a powder. Snorted just a bit to be sure of not having a negative reaction. Each of us was fine after 15 minutes and then sniffed a full line. In 5 minutes I thought I needed to sit down before I fell down. Peaking already, I saw my friends moving slowly around the patio and I rose to my feet. While I did not fall down, my body movements were all over the place as was my mouth. The words were intelligible, but i was saying things that I would not normally saw.

I did not understand the term disassociatives before. Now I understand. My mind left my physical body. Arms and legs flailing around like a serious hadicap and feeling reaaly groovy. Aside from the naseau, I felt great, albeit out of control. I kept wondering what I might do if a visitor were to arrive. No way that I could conceal this buzz. I have tried lots of potent drugs over the years, but this one might be the strongest. After my experience, at least 3 months went by before I thought I might try Ketamine again. Use with caution.</bodytext></report>
