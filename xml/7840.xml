I did cocaine for the first time tonight. I started off with about one line of coke, which I snorted about 3/4 of it, lost the rest cause it was my first time. I had been drinking earlier and after about 10 minutes I felt quite a bit more sober than earlier (noticeable difference) and my focus was quite good. I started playing video games with some friends and I was concentrating very hard without trying. While the clarity was nice the only other noticeable difference from my normal mindset was the actual adrenaline rush that it gives. It was just like drinking a lot of caffeine in my opinion. I did find I was quite a bit more relaxed during this period. I was also somewhat restless and moved about quite a bit. After about a half hour I snorted another line which was the rest of it and got all of it in. Again the clarity and the nervous energy. I spent most of my time hanging out outside, enjoying the cool breeze.

The only noticeable side affect that I could tell was that I started to sweat just a little. Other than that I didn't even get bad runs done the back of my throat. All in all a mediocre experience and certainly not worth paying for. Of course it was mediocre cocaine, so perhaps when I can get a hold of some better quality I'll try it again.</bodytext></report>
