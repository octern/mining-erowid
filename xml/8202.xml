I didn't know at all what to expect from this new [to me] drug. Didn't read any reports, information or whatsoever. All I knew that it purposively would make me trip like hell.

The first time I tried it, I was with a couple of mates. Being the only one taking it, the constant questioning of 'what do you see, what do you feel' disabled me to have a decent trip. I was trying to explain that there was a 'forse' pushing me. Anyway, I realized that communicating with people while on Salvia was a waste of the trip.

Knowing this, I decided that my second salvia experience had to happen in isolation.

Home alone next day, I stuffed my pipe with 100mg of the extract holding all puffs in as long as I could. The same feeling as the day before came to me. Some sort of energy forse was pushing me about.

The best way to describe this 'forse' is that it was similar to the feeling I get after swimming in the waves of the ocean. When I come out of the water, I sometimes still feel the waves. Only this feeling is very weak compared the the forse of Salvia. The other effect were that everything had geometrical shapes and strange colors. My mind was trippy and I found myself thinking weird thoughts.

Although I was pretty wasted, I wasn't satisfied with the effects. 10 minuted later I started smoking another 100mg. This is where the trip turned to extreme...

I inhaled the last drag an held it in. After an indefinite period of time I found myself standing in the middle of the room with a pipe in my hand and exhaling smoke. I think this small blackout lasted a minute or so. I dropped the pipe and sat down on the floor on my knees. The geometrical shapes and the forse got stronger than ever, but these were just side effects compared to what was to come next...

All of a sudden I got this overwhelming feeling. Seconds later I found myself in a new reality. It seemed as if I was right at the border of two realities. leaving one to go into the other, yet only a few feet away from the border line. 
/n

The feeling of deja-vu grew in me. I knew for sure I've been to this place before. Not from other drug trips though. Maybe dreams? The new reality seemed very familiar, yet I felt like an alien in it. A feeling of being somewhere not meant to be. I thought this place isn't just a trip or hallucination. It must be real. Maybe it's the REAL reality?  All these thoughts raced through my head.

I was really out of it at this point and remember thinking how lucky I was that Salvia only lasts a couple of minutes. This is probably what kept me calm and going with the flow.

When I came down about 10-15 minutes later, I was totally confused, astonished and stunned at the same time. I tried to conclude what had happened. I tried to give meaning to my experience, yet couldn't.

I will definitely try Salvia again, hoping to go back to that reality, other state of mind, or however you can call it. After reading a couple of dozen reports afterward, I noticed how familiar all the experiences are--unlike all other drugs. Its still a mystery what triggers the effects of Salvia. To me its a mystery why all users experience the same effects. Maybe the magic of Salvia goes deeper than neural chemistry--who knows--until then let us psychonauts discover what this plant is trying to show us...</bodytext></report>
