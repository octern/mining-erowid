The tanks just got filled.  Even if we didn't make any money off them, who would it hurt to take a few balloons.  (17 inch ones, not the small ones). That was the situation a few months ago, when it was warmer.  It was no big deal selling gas, but now its cold and business has stopped.  But not everything has stopped.  The few balloons that I use to take has turned into fifteen balloons at a time.  I stopped hanging out with a lot of friends to hang out with a more possessive one, the tank.  The best part about it is we (me and by buddy) had four tanks between us.  The tanks totaled Seventy-five pounds altogether. (that's a lot of balloons, to give you an idea, we figured about five, 17 inch balloons per pound).

It turned into hitting the tank all nights of the week.  My fingers soon became tingly and very cold.  I began to get stupid.  Not in the way most people would think, I would forget parts of physical function.  I dunno its hard to explain, but I didn't randomly start forgetting everything I had ever learned.  You would not think, looking at me, that I would ever be a nitrous zealot.  I am in great physical condition, and my diet is right on.  For gods sake, I work at GNC!

Oh sure it was fun, and it always will be, but I had learned the hard way. I don't know if I will return back to normal, hopefully I will, eventually.  Just be aware, it does happen to people.</bodytext></report>
