At 2:00 on a friday my friend gave me a pill that looked like mdma and told me it was pma. It was supose to take 2 hours to hit the plan was take at 2;00 and go over his house at 3:30.

So here I am sitting in school at 2:00 I ingest the pill (160mg) and it all went wrong within 5 minutes. I felt sick then I started to pour sweat and the room started to shake it hit in 7 minutes after taking it.  I thought that I was going to die. I literally felt death I almost passed out. I was seeing flashes of colors every where. My heart felt like it was going to explode. I have done alot of psyhcoactives in school (lsd, mdma, shrooms), but this was far to intense for school I almost blacked out, but my friend talked me down. After school iwas still feeling the intensity. At 3:30 when I got to my friends house the intensity was gone but I had a mellow, drowsy feeling. During those 5 hours I hallucinated pretty hard and I smoked 3or 4 bowls which made the hallucinations more intense. I enjoyed those 5 hours sitting and listening to the beatles.

To this day that was the most intense high I ever had. Since the expierence I have done pma 3 more times, but I am never taking a whole pill(160mg) again. I only do half pills. It is still intense but not asintense as a whole pill. If anybody reads this and wants to do pma or gets a double-stacked white mitsuibisi which is not mdma, but pma I strongly recommened do not do a whole pill only do half.</bodytext></report>
