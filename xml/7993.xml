Well, I had been on the outlook for some Ecstacy for a while, and I was really happy when a friend dropped by to tell me he had a few pills called roosters, so I bought them off him.

Later that evening, me and 4 people sat down at my house to drop them, all the usual preparations were made, calm psychedelic music, bottles of water, salty crackers, the works, nothing unusual there.

We dropped them all at the same time and began to wait, just chatting away. Well, about 40 minutes later, I was beginning to feel nauseous, not like the mild nausea with E, but really nauseous. I have a hard stomach though, so I didn't puke, perhaps I should've.. A couple of my friends raced to the bathroom and puked their guts out big time though, and about at the same time I began to feel unusual feelings, not like on MDMA in any way.

My muscles tensed up and my legs started twitching, I got a bit dizzy, like with alcohol intoxication, and my hearing changed somewhat, my ability to localize sounds was impaired. If someone to my right spoke 10 meters away, I would think he was 1 meter away to the left.

It just got worse and worse, and my heartbeat picked up big time, I was cold-shivering and hot-shivering at the same time, and my head just literally pounded with every heartbeat.. By now I was really panicky, I felt like I was insane, I had paranoid thoughts racing through my mind at crazy speeds and I had no way to control them.
/n

I called a few mates I know who are very experienced with all kinds of drugs and they tried to help me with the usual things to do, 'eat something, take a shower, mellow down, change the setting' .. but nothing seemed to work, and I was in real panic and kept considering calling 911 because I was sure I was going to die.

I had mild visuals as well, distorted lights, patterns and colours as well.

Stupidly enough, I sat down at my computer to find some info on bad chemicals usually contained in ecstacy, and I wound up at one explaining PMA, and I quickly related to everything written there, which only made things worse, since I had heard so many bad things about it.. Well, luckily I was able to control myself and satisfy my mind with that it I wouldn't stay this way forever, I would eventually come down.. and I did, with some new experiences learned.

I learned control over my mind before my body.
/n
/n
I learned how to handle myself in panic situations.
/n
/n
and last but not least, I got a very important lesson about how dangerous things sold under the name Ecstacy really can be. It's not all love and euphoria.

I really do not dare to think of what the consequences might have been if I had been in different settings, like at a rave party, I'm completely sure I would have died in that case.</bodytext></report>
