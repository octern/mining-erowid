I sent off for a 1/2 an ounce of dried salvia leaf and was very happy to recieve my order in a couple of days.  I had to wait for the right time to do it, but it came.  It was about 11 o'clock at night and I filled up my water bong with some kiwi soda stuff, and took my first long hit, nearly passing out from holding it in too long.  Well, I didn't feel much, and packed another bowl, and took another long hit.  As I was holding it in, I felt like I was being lifted off the ground.  There was a hard tug upwards.  I put my bong away.

I walked around and felt really high, I would turn around a little and it felt like I was flung around, I was really off balance.

I went to lie down on my bed, feeling really good, and closed my eyes.  First off I didn't see much, but then I started seeing what looked like little joints, of very small fibers underneath a microscope.  They were rich in color, saturated in blue, then red, green, yellow, orange.  It was very asthetically pleasing, but I was kind of dissapointed.  Not for long...

All of a sudden, there was a flash of color and a multicolored, dimensional tarantula appeared, it then dissolved into dozens of smaller spiders that then turned into a liquid and started twirling around.  Then there were many patterns, and I saw palm trees, and fire, everything was in beautiful fluxuating color.  I loved it.

There was a huge flash, like lightning, I don't know if it really was or if it was the salvia.  I then drifted off into sleep.

This was a very goog experience of salvia, I highly reccomend it, and I will pursue learning about the plant and using it.</bodytext></report>
