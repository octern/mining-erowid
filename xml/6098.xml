ive taken 2ct7, mainly nasaly (for reasons of economy) on a number of occasions and have noticed that the visuals dont completely go away.... what ive noticed the most is that when you are relaxed and aware the air seems to move, i wonder sometimes if your brain is storing this drug and what other effects it may have.

 some people may consider this positive, others negative. to be honest i dont know what to make of it but bear it in mind when you decide to try some yourself.

  i would not recomend snorting 2ct7 as it is not only painfull but dangerous. i always experience severe nausea and ive seen people go into delirium when they come up. i think it could be easy to suffocate on your own vomit with this stuff. I think that the manufacturers should start supplying this stuff in a form that cannot be snorted to minimise health risks.

[erowid note: 2CT7 is not sold for human consumption in the United States, although it has been sold in Europe in pills under the brand Blue Mystic.

If sold as a recreational psychoactive, 2C-T-7 would likely fall under both federal and state Analogue Acts, so selling it in any form designed to reduce risks of ingestion is more illegal in the United States than selling pure chemicals to be used in labs.]</bodytext></report>
