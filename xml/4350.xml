As some of you probably know, snorting 2C-T-7 hurts horribly.  I don't think it burns much, it's more of a very intense pain.  I found that lidocaine -- and I'm sure many other -caines would work as well -- completely removes all the pain.

I weigh out 60mg lidocaine and separate it into 6 lines.  I snorted the first and then one more every 30 seconds or so until there was only one left--just in case.  Then I quickly snorted 10mg of 2C-T-7.  There was absolutely no pain what so ever.  I now went to the bathroom and prepared for the intense nausea that followed.  After that, I washed my mouth out and blew my nose.  I recently learned stomach acids are very bad for your teeth.  As I noticed a small amount of pain I snorted the remaining line.</bodytext></report>
