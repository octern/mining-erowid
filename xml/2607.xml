I took five capsules of kava and five st.john's wort (the capsules are extremely cheap, about 5 to 7 dollars for a bottle, they are dried plant parts ground and encapsulated)and opened them all up to collect all the powder into one amount.  I emptied one side of a tea bag, poured the powder into it and then tied off the top.  Then I made a regular cup of tea with it.  It kicks in very fast, smooth, relaxing.  Made me doze off a couple of times while watching t.v. that night.  Overall, very warm and fuzzy.  Good stress relief.</bodytext></report>
