Well, after doing some carefull research on Methcathione, I decided that I would go ahead and try to make some.  The recipe's all over the 'net right now and let me tell ya, it works.

The most annoying part of the whole experience was trying to find the potassium permanganate.  The faq decribed where I might find it and I went to most of those places a few times.  Finally I found it.  If anyone out there is having the same problem I did here's a bit of advice: the bottles are usually pretty damn big and placed in boxes for selling.  So it may not even look like a chem at first glance.  Just read the labels carefully.

My friend T and I set out to make about three grams.  Not too much or anything, just enought to see if the recipe worked.  After evaporating off most of the water, we had what looked like about two g's.

All night long we smoked this stuff.  Very fun.  The taste is very close to crank smoke.  I actually think it is identical.  The effects are a little different.

I'm not a speed freak (anymore), I grew somewhat out of it after high school.  I still remember though, what good meth feels like.  Methcathinone comes nowhere close.  The euphoria is just not there compared to meth.  There was a strong sense of energy with some light headedness.  I felt pretty damn good all night.  We polished off what we had in like three hours.  The stuff got me spinnin' pretty hard, but it kept me fiendin' for more all night.  I didn't feel a strong comedown, it's just that the plateau began to wear off and I would miss it so bad.  But, all in all a good experience.</bodytext></report>
