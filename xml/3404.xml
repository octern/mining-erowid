Continuing my experimentation with household spices, I took an oral dose of 6 nuts, grated into slivers with a normal knife (same method of preparation as my nutmeg-smoking venture) and took it orally by the method of taking 'shots' of it, followed by long gulps of various liquids (I tried milk, orange juice, and water -- all of them were fairly satisfactory).

Sometime during this venture, I fell asleep, and had very vivid dreams. Waking up, I felt very disoriented, and walked like I was very, very drunk. I sat down, and felt a wave of sexual excitement come over me. I masturbated, along with a mental fantasy which was lived out in my body (I felt tactile sensations in other parts of my body). I intend to try intercourse on nutmeg, with my partner also under the influence (consensually, of course!) sometime soon. Nutmeg, apparently, can be strong sexual enhancer.
