I have just come off my first datura(Jimson weed/Devil's weed) 'trip'. I use the word 'trip', due to the lack of a better option. I truly thought that I have seen almost everything that drugs can do a couple of days ago.I was dead-wrong. So many things happened; I'll tell you about 1.

I was inside my bathroom for more than half an hour talking to someone. I did not know who he was but I saw him every now and again. I did not like seeing him, because he was a very irritating fellow. Anything I did, he would do; if I rubbed my cheek, he would do the same in a horibly exact replica of my actions.This really pissed me off. I was however too fast for him on certain occasions. This morning I realised that I had been talking to the mirror.

This is very dangerous stuff.If you don't feel mentally and spiritually competent and cleansed ,don't go near her, for she will drive you insane permanently, or if you're a bit more lucky, she will kill you.

Handle Her with the utmost respect and care, and your life will take on a new dimension.I must emphasize that I did a lot of research and was scared shitless, if not I would probably been Her latest victim (and there have been many!)
