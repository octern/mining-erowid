I was 17 years old when i firsly entered the imaginary world of chemicals. I started with ecxtasy pills, continued with lsd, tried crack, snifed heroin and finally i tried 'the magic dust' as my clubbing friends used to call it...Cocaine.

I remember it was christmas eve 1995. I had taken 2 ecxtasy pills but i still wanted sth more. So my friend elisa's. Had the idea of us trying something different..Cocaine.That was it!! I had just commited the 'biggest crime' of my life.From that moment and on my life had become a battle for finding the coke. I spend any dime i ever got, from my work or parents in purchasing coke. I felt sick 24hrs/day using or not cocaine...My life was a living hell.

My friends tried to tell me to slow down but i thought i could control it. My dosage went from 4 lines to 2gr and i lost 20pounds in one month...My hair started to lose its shine, my nails broke easier, my face was like a 30 years old lady. It was terrible until one day i saw one of my best friends die from a stroke provoked my cocaine overdose. That was the beginning of my struggle of rehab. I have been clear for a year now and my life has got a meaning again...</bodytext></report>
