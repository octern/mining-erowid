Before this all goes down I would just like to say I have rolled and had a great time with little or no after effects (mentally and physically).

So one night I was at work and a co-worker asked me if I would like to purchase some E from him.  I gladly bought 4 and at 8:00 pm, as soon as i got off, i popped one. About an hour later i felt warm and fuzzy and all E-ish.  I started to clench my jaw and kinda chew my cheek (good way).  When I got home at about 9:00 I popped another.  I took a nice relaxing shower.  This is a great feeling on E.  I noticed though that i was starting to bite my mouth more and more.  So I made a note in my mind and tried to stop.  About a hlaf an hour passed and i popped the last 2 and continued my E night listening to music.  But i continued to bite my mouth and it got worse.  It didnt hurt but i knew it wasnt right.  I later fell asleep and awoke with cuts and gashs on the inside of my lower lip near the corners of my lip.  It was very gross.

About two days later they evolved into the worst canker sores i have ever had.  My lip became swollen and i couldnt talk, i couldnt eat, couldnt sleep, couldnt swollow all because of these canker sores.  I had had canker sores before but these caused the most physical pain i had ever been in.  I do not do E any longer because of this and i regret having one night of near bliss for 2 weeks of near mind losing pain.</bodytext></report>
