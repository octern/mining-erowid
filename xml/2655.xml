On my plane ride to Acapulco for spring break on the airplane I decided to take a couple caps of G since there was no alcohol being served on the plane because it was all young college kids. i took more than i usually do and ended up vomiting all over the place and passing out for a couple of hours without remembering anything. when i regained conciousness all my friends around me showed me the video tape they had recorded while i was passed out.the flight attendants had cleaned me up with the help of my friends and then made someone hold an oxygen mask attached to a small tank over my nose and mouth the entire time i was unconcious. i didn't remember any of it and i had an awful hangover all that night and the next morning.</bodytext></report>
