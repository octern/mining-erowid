This is the real deal folks. Eat light, but not too light. This buzz will last between 5 - 8 hours (estimated 1 hour per ounce consumed). Chug 8 oz. (in touch with god, very strong buzz), 6 oz. (feeling extremely happy with hallucinations) or 4 oz. (continual buzz) and not less than 4 oz. Chug it!!! Then finish it off with a big glass of water to get the horrible taste out of your mouth. Then, do not eat or drink anything else for about an hour. This would be a great time to watch a movie or something. During this hour you may feel a bit queezy and dizzy. Right before you feel really sick (if you can last 1 and 1/2  hours), smoke a fatty. Then you are off on a psychedelic journey. Be sure to have good music on and visuals - i recomment The Orb (Advertures Beyond the Ultraworld) or Orbital or any techno music. Another great visual is Minds Eye or Virtual Nature (with the other music as background). Sit back, Relax and Enjoy the buzz!</bodytext></report>
