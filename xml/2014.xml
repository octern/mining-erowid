The taste: absolutely disgusting. Trust your intuition regarding dose - pour a load into a saucepan, add water, boil &amp; simmer for 20 minutes, strain, add a generous amount of honey and have a piece of fruit ready for afterwards. Be prepared to go for a pretty violent shit at some point. You need to have a healthy constitution before taking this. Senses are heightened, there's are feeling of paranoia, edginess, nervousness, urgency too, like Something's about to happen. I had it one Saturday night. It kicks in suddenly, say 3 hours later. I had the sudden urge to go and see the late show of Sleepy Hollow - before wandering around my (mostly deserted) halls of residence feeling like Jack Nicholson in The Shining. But........ next morning, a most pleasant hangover feeling, all nice and relaxing and a feeling that almost anything is possible.
