I ordered some Damiana so I could get a legal buzz.  I was disappointed in the effects.  My expectations were not that high, but I hoped to feel something of substance.  The texture was nice for rolling a joint and the taste was pretty good, kinda flowery.  However, there was no effect.  I used one friend as a follow up test group.  He felt nothing.  This substance will disappoint those who are looking for a legal marijuana type high.  It is not bad as a cigarette substitute.

One note however, I gave another drag to the same friend who was coming down off morning glory seeds and this time he got a buzz off it.  Said it kinda revived the LSA feeling stronger.  Gave some to the friend a third time when he was sober and no effects.  In conclusion, if you think this stuff will get you high, think again ( unless maybe if you take it with pschodelics).</bodytext></report>
